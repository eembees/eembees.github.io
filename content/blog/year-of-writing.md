Last year, 2024 was a [year of adventure](../year-of-adventure). This year I've been trying to find a new [theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) to follow, and landed that 2025 will be my __year of writing__. Hence, this blog, this post. 

## Why Writing?
My fascination with writing was first picked when reading _Artemis Fowl_, as a kid. In the book he mentions that all his idols kept a diary, and therefore he would start his own. Personally I don't have the same world-domination-level ambitions as Mr. Fowl but the passage _did_ give me pause to think about the _effects_ of ~daily~ regular writing. Since then I've dabbled with journaling, diary-keeping, and some attempts at technical writing at my previous job, none of which were published externally. 

## Why Now?

During December, my brother and I held an [Advent Blog challenge](/blog/advent-blog-24/) for ourselves, to catch up with each other, long-form but regular. The results were surpringly positive and we've both since decided to continue writing; expect more to be published on this blog going forward. 

I'm also at the moment looking for new employment and I think a time of idle dallying is the best time to start new side-projects. Hopefully I'll be able to keep this up once I've got an employment situation set up as well. 



As for a strategy - I'm still experimenting. I'd love to continue finishing up my [travel writing](/travel/) and I'll be back-dating and publishing some old posts and writings from different fora on this page as well.
