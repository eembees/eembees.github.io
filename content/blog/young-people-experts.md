## Why is this happening?

### We value experts less
When governments of Western Europe speak, the people trust that what they say is true. [^3] 
During the COVID pandemic, the populations of both Norway and Denmark, which I experienced lockdowns in, obeyed the restrictions put in place by the governmental bodies. *NB. consider finding another example to support this*
This has the knock-off effect that people take the arguments that politicians use as _factual_.
Traditionally this is due to a strong tradition of elected officials taking advice from experts. 
However, it seems as if the tide is about to turn.
Across governments in Scandinavia, experts are valued less and less. *Add sources here?*
From Danish Govenmernt officials officially disheeding expert advice (green 3part?) to the Norwegian Government disheeding experts in minind operations out in the north sea, we see government taking expert very unseriously. 
For kids in high school age, deciding what to do with their lives, the message is clear: Expert advice is not valued, not useful, and will not give influence, status or position in society.

Another element of this is driven by the short-form content that we're conditioned into consuming information by. 
Some go as far as to say society in itself is [anti-intellectualist](https://www.wheresyoured.at/why-we-shouldnt-be-surprised-people/). 
I'd not go as far, and rather say that we've allowed pseudo-intellectual discourse to take over forums for debate. 

## Better access to education means we merit it lower value
Democratization of education is a good thing at face value.
However, when something becomes less scarce, it becomes less respected as well. 
Currently, we're lucky enough to be in a situation where everyone can get a higher education, but that also means we have less respect for people with higher education. 


### The road to becoming an expert is increasingly difficult

The first reason I can think of is the fact that we have a strong, strong trust in what politicians say. With this in mind, there has been an increase in politicians disheeding and disregarding what experts say [find source]. In addition, we see more and more respect for economic forecasts and similar financial industry stakeholders in public. Very often this is easy - you can get McKinsey or Deloitte to give you exactly the conclusion you pay for. Meanwhile, academic experts are shunned and often spoken directly against. See, for example, the Brexit comments that "we have had enough of experts." Similarly, we often in Denmark have seen politicians disregard what is said from researchers' perspectives to drive political agendas.

If we can reverse this, more young people would want to go into academia.




## How do we reverse this trend?

What a difficult question. I can't think of any good way of getting out of this without majyr systemin change. However maybe it isn't all as bad as it's made out to be ?? Add context here....
Realistically there are reasons to be hopeful, since the _same dynamic that fuels desperation and activism_ also now is starting to overtake.

Furthermore, the power structures in academia are very, very unrewarding to young people - see, for example, the For Better Science


It's difficult to know whether young people are willing to _be_ experts when they grow up but it's worth considering whether or not we should make sure we keep this profession respected. A non exhaustive list of what I think could work is:

1. More young people in politics, which we can accomplish in different ways:
    - mandatory civic service for non-military engaged youth
    - an upper age limit for politicians
    - a maximum tenure time for elected officials, with a quarantine period (this second part isn't 100% failsafe but it will disrupt the possibility to stay eternally in elected office, if only a little bit)
1. A strong  research culture already in universities and high schools.
    - In norway this would mean making less engineer-y courses and more research-focused classes [^2]
    - NB Eske Willerslew discussed this at one point.

[^2]: I am obviously biased here since I was lucky to attench the Nanoscinece probrgame at YUCPH where we researched from the first course already. This was something I don't think I've realized the value of until years later. ....
