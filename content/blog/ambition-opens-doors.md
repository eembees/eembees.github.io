When you have a big goal people are more inclined to help. 
Why is that?


In my high school cross country team, we had 5 key quotes. 

1. Every Day is a Great Day
2. Goal oriented people find a way
3. We go with goal oriented people
4. Extra Effort is the key to success 
5. Don't Waste a Heartbeat 


In this case, the third one stands out the most. 
_We go with goal oriented people._ Why is that? 
As Yuval Harari discusses in Sapiens, humans are cultural beings, forming religions, belief systems, and dogma.
Humans are also wired to follow charismatic leaders, partially since charismatic people tend to be more persuasive, which grants higher social status. More on this elsewhere. 
All this comes down to humans seeking to be part of something greater than any single indvidual, a higher calling, as one might call it.
Is this what forms cults? Probably.
