Today is a very exciting day, as it marks my first day back at work after my [year of adventure](../year-of-adventure). 
I'll be joining the brilliant team built by [Mads](https://x.com/madskaysen) and [Jesper](https://alkestrup.com/) building Conversational AI in [TheTechCollective](https://thetechcollective.eu/). 
I'm beyond excited.

When choosing work, I agree that "[Hell Yeah Or No](https://sive.rs/hellyeah)"  is the way to approach work. In the case of working with the team at TTC, it's a big Hell Yeah from me. 

## Continuing the startup vibe in a BigCorp way
