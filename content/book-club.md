Here are my notes for book club. 


# First book - *Yellowface* by R.F. Kuang 
**Hot take**: 
- I'm honestly surprised this is on the bestseller list. 
- Character development was very one-dimensional and the narrator is just 100% a bad person.
- Story line is also a bit far fetched and in that it's not super nuanced. 


In terms of themes, the first thing that strikes me is that this is a hit back at everyone who ever criticized R.F. Kuang and painting them in as bad as possible light. There's the "Asian-American author who struggles in publishing" themes that come throughout but I was honestly hoping this book would be a bit deeper than that. Instead I'm left dissapointed.  
On the other hand maybe I'm not the audience for this book.

**Other takes**: Most people in the book club also agreed this was a far fetched storyline. And why doesn't the narrator have _any_ friends but her alleged best friend is super popular and loves people? This book is just complaining and that's no fun for anyone. 

**My Rating**: 2/5 stars

**Average Book Club Rating**: 3.5/5 stars

# Second Book - *Drive your plow over the bones of the dead* by Olga Tokarczuk
## Hot takes and reading notes 

- Why are we personifying every damn plant and animal here. This lady must have a close connection w nature. 
- Oh no she likes horoscopes. Looks like I'm in for a ride.
- Murder mystery? Horoscopes? What's the probability that there is a natural explanation to it all?
- Meta-comment: I've a hard time to understand if this is a book of fiction or a fantasy book where the supernatural part will only be revealed in the end.
- this lady doesn't believe in names, which is cute if you're 14 but weird if youre 64 ... or however old this nutjob is
- Lady definitely does not like people. Wow. No love lost between her and neighbors, with some small exceptions of 
    - people who let her rant without telling her she is insane
    - people who share (some of) her particular convictions. 
- III: She has the TV on all the time, from breakfast until bedtime. Rationalizes by saying *"Dawn imperceptibly fades into the Dusk [...] the window panes merely reflect the inside of my kitchen, the small, cluttered centre of the Universe."*  I want to kill her
- For some reason this lady keeps talking about the Czech Republic as this magical place where all is good. Why does she keep thinking that?
- IX: I'm about 98.5% sure this lady is killing all her neighbors who like hunting. And just trying to explain why she is a murderer by horoscopes and Saturns sixth Mars ascendant. 
- Is she trying to get caught by writing these letters to the police? Like, why? This lady is clearly delusional.
  - Is this a *Cassandra* type thing? Is she like prescient and understands animals (is it a fantasy novel?).
- ANOTHER LETTER! come on lady make it more obvious that you killed these people in cold blood. At this point I'm only finishing the book to avoid the penalty.
- XV: ok, what a funny Blake reference. It all makes sense. I looked up the poem:

> In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.  
> **Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead.**  
> The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.  
> *Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.*  
> He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence.  
> *The cut worm forgives the plow.*

Italics and bold is mine, but I suppose that's the theme. The ugly old maid courted by Incapacity is the narrator, and she sees her acts ploughing down her neighbors as tilling the field and removing worms. Cool. That didn't really resonate with me. I'm wondering how this type of ideas would be seen if we were discussing [Marc Andreesen's Techno Optimist Manifesto](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto).

**My Rating**: 3/5 stars. Better than Yellowface because it kept me on edge until the end to figure out if I was in fact reading a fantasy novel about elves. 

**Average Book Club Rating**: ?/5 stars

# Third Book - *Lord of the Flies*
> Reading Reading Reading.

Read it some years ago so re reading will be cool.  
I think I'll read with the eyes of an adult looking at how the world has changed since 1954, when .


Since most of Goldings' thoughts about young kids [have been shown to be completely unrealistic](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months), I guess it could be an interesting study of building a narrative that supports your own point of view? Golding was an alcoholic war veteran turned schoolmaster after all, the type of which inspired this great [Pink Floyd](https://www.pinkfloyd.net/albums/index.php?lyrics=6#4) lyric:

> When we grew up and went to school  
> There were certain teachers who would  
> Hurt the children in any way they could  
> "OOF!"  
> By pouring their derision  
> Upon anything we did  
> And exposing every weakness  
> However carefully hidden by the kids

# Fourth Book - **On the Road** by J Kerouac 
Immediate Thoughts
- Enjoyed the language describing Bebop and jazz clubs. Evident that music definitely touches the narrator closely, also shown in the parts discussing mambo music in mexico
- Paradoxical situation: Sal describes all Deans adventures and frenzies as sometimes downright irresponsible and "far out" but seems to brush of his own, similarly crazy experiences.
- Towards the end, re-introducing the people that adored Dean but now are grown up and tell him to grown up, are an interesting piece of plot. It brings out the theme that many of these were not necessairly Deans _friend_ rather just using him or somehow gaining from his prescence under the pretense of friendship 
- Towards the ending the monotony of travel seems to have worn our narrator out as even the Road becomes mundane. I think many backpackers can relate to this feeling.
- In contrast, it seems like there is nogthing in the narrators life except from life On The Road, since he never mentions his life actually staying in the cities.

My Score: 7/10
Average book club score: 6/10

# Fifth book - **Flowers For Algernon** by Daniel Keyes
This book has _everything_, I'm impressed. The Icarian reference pierces the entire book, but the most poignant part is that the protagonist is _aware_.

### Themes

- Man vs Nature 
- Man vs God 
- Man vs Man
- Man vs Society



### Snippets I found cheesy but good 

- Where Charlie references Atreus, the greek family doomed to repent their ancestors sins. Very two-layered
- When Norma meets Charlie again and says about Rose, their senile mother: "I could not put my own _mother_ in a home ... an institution."



### Thoughts

I can't help but think that there is a sense of irony throughout the book. 

When Charlie realizes (and conveys to his assosciates/experimenters[^1]) that _intelligence is worth nothing without affection_, they invariably strike back that he has "lost something of himself ... the warm, likeable smile" that wishes to get to know others. However genuine that impression may be, the experimenters, throughout the entire first part of the book, _urge him to think of himself, keep track of himself, and otherwise focus all his mental energy on introspection_. 

My main qualm with this is that for some reason none of the experimenters realize that Charlies developmental path forces him to go through socialization one more time. Considering that all his social cues point him to focus on himself it's not very unnatural that he turns out arrogant, with a strong chip on his shoulder to authority.[^2] He's even explicitly rewarded for questioning authority early on - why are the experimenters surprised when he, as the prodigal lab rat, escapes?



[^1]: In this case, I think it's prudent to name Alice part of the experimenters.
[^2]: Note to self, Kevin Simler wrote something about this here: [Personality: The Body in Society | Melting Asphalt](https://meltingasphalt.com/personality-the-body-in-society/)
