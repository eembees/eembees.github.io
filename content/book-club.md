Here are my notes for book club. 


# First book - Yellowface by R.F. Kuang 
**Hot take**: 
I'm honestly surprised this is on the bestseller list. 
Character development was very one-dimensional and the narrator is just 100% a bad person.
Story line is also a bit far fetched and in that it's not super nuanced. 

In terms of themes, the first thing that strikes me is that this is a hit back at everyone who ever criticized R.F. Kuang and painting them in as bad as possible light. There's the "Asian-American author who struggles in publishing" themes that come throughout but I was honestly hoping this book would be a bit deeper than that. Instead I'm left dissapointed.  

On the other hand maybe I'm not the audience for this book.

**Other takes**: Most people in the book club also agreed this was a far fetched storyline. And why doesn't the narrator have _any_ friends but her alleged best friend is super popular and loves people? This book is just complaining and that's no fun for anyone. 

**My Rating**: 2/5 stars

**Average Book Club Rating**: 3.5/5 stars
