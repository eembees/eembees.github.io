Hi, I'm Magnus! ðŸ‘‹

In 2015 I moved to Copenhagen to pursue my lifelong dream of studying Nanoscience. Shortly thereafter I found myself growing an [education non-profit](https://eypdk.org/) working for youth participation in liberal democracies.
Due to a clerical error I ended up on exchange in Beijing, China, instead of on Erasmus. I tried (and failed) to learn Mandarin, went to Japan to ski, and returned to Scandinavia with a new dose of humility.
In 2020 I abandoned a Ph.D. in Nanoscience to work in with Corti, a healthtech AI startup.
4 years later I realized I'm getting older at a very rapid pace and took a year off to bicycle and trad climb.

[Now](./now.md) I've returned to living in my NÃ¸rrebro collective and will probably stay around until the wanderlust gene starts hitting again.
