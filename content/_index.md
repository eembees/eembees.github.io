Hi, I'm Magnus! 👋

In 2015 I moved to Copenhagen to pursue my lifelong dream [^1] of studying Nanoscience. Shortly thereafter I found myself managing an EU-centered non-profit [insert EYP words here]. 



In 2020 I abandoned my lifelong dream [^1] of studying Nanoscience to work in the tech industry. 



Due to a clerical error[^2] I ended up on exchange in Beijing, China, instead of on Erasmus ...

 

## What [Now?](./now.md) ☺️





[^1]: Or since-age-12 dream.
[^2]: Or "forgetting the application deadline"
