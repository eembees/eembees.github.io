Hi, I'm Magnus! 👋

## Me in 3 sentences

I come from Trondheim, Norway, and currently live in Copenhagen. 
I've also lived in Houston and Beijing for shorter periods of time.

In my spare time, I like to climb, run, contribute to local organizations, and write. In general, I will say [yes more than no](./yep).

For more, see my [About](./about.md).

## What [Now?](./now.md) ☺️
