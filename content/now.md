This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

Returned back to Copenhagen this fall after a summer bikepacking and climbing in Lofoten and Bohuslän. 

I just read [The Good Virus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62586006-the-good-virus) and growing increasingly interested in microbiology and biophysics. 

# What I'm working on
After 4 years with [Corti](https://corti.ai), I'm taking a break and looking for new projects.

Along with some talented colleagues from UCPH and CBS, we're designing a new AI course for [DIS Copenhagen](https://disabroad.org/).

I'm also keeping busy with board work at [Nørrebro Klatreklub](http://nkk.dk/).
