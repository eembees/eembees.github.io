# My life

Just left Copenhagen winter for Patagonia over winter. Catch my [travel section](./travel) for more details. 

I just read [The Good Virus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62586006-the-good-virus) and growing increasingly interested following progress in microbiology and biophysics.
See my [science section](./science) for an overview of the articles I've been reading.

# My work
After 4 years with [Corti](https://corti.ai), I'm taking a break and looking for new projects.

Along with some talented colleagues from UCPH and CBS, we're designing a new AI course for [DIS Copenhagen](https://disabroad.org/).

I'm also keeping busy with board work at [NÃ¸rrebro Klatreklub](http://nkk.dk/).
